This test code sets up a basic structure for testing the `remove_activations` function. It includes a method `test_remove_activations` where you would implement specific checks based on the expected behavior of the model after the activation functions have been removed. You would need to instantiate your model (`model_instance`) and prepare input data (`input_data`) suitable for testing. The assertion `self.assertNotEqual(id(modified_model), id(model_instance), "The model should be altered after applying remove_activations")` checks that the model object has indeed changed, indicating that the function has performed its task. Additional assertions could include checking the structure of the model or specific outputs of the model before and after the function is applied.
